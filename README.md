Hey! Forget Quantum Computers, Graphene Radiators, Lucid Dream Hats… Where are we going to drive in the Bulletproof EVs? Through square fields and rivers with leached chemicals, to the nearest pine tree plantation that is harvested for cardboard?
Now is the time for garden robots which will make xenocides obsolete. 

Project Phase 1:

Project Phase 2:

Ultrasound position from quadcopter research:

I've found a new robotic arm system for high-force garden robots, it costs $2000, and can be prototyped on wall paint mechanisms.

I'm sharing the design for free, because here in France, strawberries and cherries from shops have been found with up to 35 phytosanitary chemicals, apples are coated 33 times with chemicals according the Treatment Frequency Index (TFI). Technology can change that! Autonomous landing rockets are now the norm. The biggest challenge to pesticide-free food is community perception, and recieved stereotypes predating AI and technophobes. 

We use 6 billion pounds of pesticides every year. As an ornithologist I've seen bird species, hirondelles, vanished from the region. Now, the mechanisms and AI are here for to make zero-labor farming accessible to all. What is missing is big voices to announce a paradigm change in tech. Please forward this project to your friends. Thanks! 

The research encompasses a diverse array of disciplines, mechatronics, biophysics, AI and wildlife. As a hobby it is a good way to discover astonishing facts of science and technology.  The following is a design guide for labs and university students. Hopefully it can prompt eco-friendly technologies to come sooner. https://archive.org/details/species-bot-a-farm-robot-by-sniper-gaulois
