Hey! Forget Bulletproof EVs, Quantum Computers, Graphene Radiators, Lucid Dream Caps, AI Datacentersâ€¦ Where are we going to drive in the Bulletproof EVs? Through square fields and rivers with leached chemicals, to the nearest pine tree plantation that is harvested for cardboard?
Now is the Time For Garden Robots.

I've found a new robotic arm system for high-force garden robots, it costs only 2000, and can be prototyped on wall paint mechanisms.
I'm sharing the design for free, because we use 6 billion pounds of pesticides every year, and Les Hirondelles birds have vanished from gran's home so i'm pissed. Here in France, apples are coated 33 times with chemicals according the Treatmen Frequency Index (TFI), Strawberries and cherries from shops have been found with up to 35 phytosanitary chemicals.. Technology can change that! Autonomous landing rockets are now the norm. The biggest challenge to pesticide-free food is community perception, popular belief, and recieved stereotypes predating AI. Now, the mechanisms and AI are here.
